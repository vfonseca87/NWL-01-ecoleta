Notes from classes #01

Create a new file called "index.html". You should avoid create names with spaces or any special character, like "introdução.hmtl" or "página inicial.html". This could be cause some problems in the future. 

To make comments block in html, you need to use the following structure

<!-- Como fazer comentários em HTML
    Meu comentário vai aqui.
    Posso fazer mais linhas de comentários aqui também.
    E aqui também.
 -->

 The standart HTML page needs to have, at least the following tags:
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <head> </head>
  <body> body text goes here </body>

  If you use the VSCODE, you can have some help from the "Enmet Abbreviation". Just type "! + Enter". The Enmet will create a standart structure for you hmtl file.

<!-- Basic structure for a html file

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
    </html>

-->

The acronym for HTML means "Hyper Text Markup Language". HTML is not a language program. 

h1, h2, h3, h4 are titles used inside body tag. The differences between then is the size text. h1 is the largest one, and they will decrement the size with higher number.

The tags could be called as elements.

Box Model: The box model is represented by the tag <div> </div>. You can put elements inside this box.
